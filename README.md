# Flipper Poser
This is the flipper poser! It's your little flipper buddy, posed for photos with **my** bad art.
Use the arrow buttons to switch between poses.

If you want to see a feature added, feel free to open an issue.

If someone submits a PR with better images, I'll create a toggle with the OK button to switch between bad and good art.
## Compilation
To compile and run for yourself, either download a fap from the releases page or follow the instructions below:

1. Set up a python venv and download the package `ufbt`
2. Type `ufbt` to generate the fap in the dist directory, or use `ufbt launch` to launch and install the app on your flipper.
3. That's it! It's easy, ain't it.
