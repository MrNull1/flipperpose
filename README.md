# Flipper Poser
This is the flipper poser! It's your little flipper buddy, posed for photos with ***my*** bad art.
Use the arrow buttons to switch between poses.
You can also use the `Ok` button to switch between good and bad art.

(oh, and I made this entirely in vim because I hate myself)

If you want to see a feature added, feel free to open an issue on github.

Thanks to Danucosuko on Github for the better art.
